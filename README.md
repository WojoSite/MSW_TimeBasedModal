<h1>Time Based Modal</h1>
<p>I created a time-based modal pop-up for a fictional organization. The modal appears on the screen after a few seconds and asks users to sign up to receive regular updates. There is also a button to exit the modal and return to the main webpage.</p>
<p>This project was an exercise as part of my NYCDA Web Development Intensive course.</p>
